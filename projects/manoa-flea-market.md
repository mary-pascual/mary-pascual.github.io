With college students being stressed with a variety of issues, my group decided to help out the students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa by creating a website similar to a flea market.

You can read more details about the website [here](https://manoa-flea-market.github.io/) or view a demo of the website [here](https://manoa-flea-market.meteorapp.com).
