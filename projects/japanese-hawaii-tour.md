For this project, I was required to have an oral presentation on which I would pretend to describe to the Japanese tourists the itinerary of the tour of Hawaii.  I was required to pick three different places and to bring up two facts about each place.  I would also have to have a brochure to pass out to the tourists.  In the end, I would need to be prepared to answer any questions the "tourists" would have about the events that would take place.

For this oral presentation, I mostly used my own experiences of living in Hawaii to prepare the oral presentation.  I was also able to use templates from Pages in my Macbook Pro in order to make my brochure.  However, since it needed to be in Japanese, I also had to use my Japanese textbooks and notebooks from previous classes in order to prepare what I was going to say.  For everything else that I wanted to say in Japanese but could not find, I would ask my friends, who were all in higher level Japanese classes.

The research for this project was easy due to the fact that I have lived in Hawaii my entire life.  Therefore, I knew which places to take the tourists in order to make the most of their experience in Hawaii.  However, it was not an easy project to do.  I think one of the most important things I learned was how important other people are when doing a project.  I took my non-introduction Japanese class in Summer 2015, which was a whole year after the last time I took a Japanese class.  I was naive into thinking I would easily be able to get through the class.  I learned the hard way that when a person doesn't study or practice Japanese for a whole year, their knowledge of the language quickly dimishes.  Though the textbooks and lectures helped, it was too structured and my knowledge was too low to the point where I couldn't manipulate the sentence structure correctly.  This especially became clear to me when I learned about this oral project.  Luckily, I had my friends as my outside resources to help me through this.  They would never tell me what to say, but they would help in correcting me whenever I practiced my presentation in front of them.  In this way, I quickly caught up to my class while learning how important it is to use help when it is there.
