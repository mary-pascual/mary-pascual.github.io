title: Policy Memo for Mental Illness Issue
permalink: projects
date: 2016
summary: A policy memorandum for the US government on the mental illness.
---

During my Fall 2016 semester, I was required to write a Policy Memorandum for the government on an issue the government currently faces.  We could choose whatever country's government and whatever issue we wanted as long it had something to do with the government.  Then, in our Policy Memorandum, we would write the summary, background, and issue with our topic and end it by writing ways to improve the issue.  For my topic, I did the issues of mental illness within the United States.
