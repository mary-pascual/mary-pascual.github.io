## What in the World is Configuration Management?

The point of the configuration management for software engineering is that it keeps track and controls the changes in a software.  By doing so, it can help to pinpoint exactly where in the software something is going wrong and shows the history to help see where the problem derived from.

I have never personally used configuration management and therefore, will probably face many problems when I first use it.  However, I do see the benefits of using it.  Especially from doing code quizzes from my ICS classes, I learned that a lot of the time I can write parts of the right code, but because I don't write them at the same time, I forget which parts work.  Then, I end up with a partially complete code that could have worked if I had parts of the code that I previously wrote but deleted.
