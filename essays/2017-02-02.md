## What in the World is Configuration Management?

The point of the configuration management for software engineering is that it keeps track and controls the changes in a software.  By doing so, it can help to pinpoint exactly where in the software something is going wrong and shows the history to help see where the problem derived from.

I have never personally used configuration management and therefore, will probably face many problems when I first use it.  However, I do see the benefits of using it.  Especially from doing code quizzes from my ICS classes, I learned that a lot of the time I can write parts of the right code, but because I don't write them at the same time, I forget which parts work.  Then, I end up with a partially complete code that could have worked if I had parts of the code that I previously wrote but deleted.  Therefore, with configuration management, I would be able to see my history and be able to combine my previously written code with my current written code and then be able to have a completely written code.

## Github vs Git

Git manages the source code history while Github services projects that use Git.  Though both towards the same goal, I would think that Github's success comes from Git.  Though Git wouldn't be able to exist without Github, it's through Git's usefulness as a tool to be fast and efficient with large projects and it's branching that helps to distinguish itself from other tools that exist.  Therefore, without Git, Github would still exist, but it wouldn't be as successful because it lacks the tools.
