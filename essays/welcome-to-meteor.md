# The Meteor Not Found in the Sky
Meteor is known for it's usefulness in creating JavaScript apps.  Especially when paired with Semantic UI, the possibilities of the kinds of websites, apps, and desktops a person can create are endless.  However, it takes a while to reach perfection, and a lot of problems can arise along the way.

## My Relationship with Meteor
From the first day I've been introduced to the Meteor app, I've been told it would not be Windows friendly.  As a Windows user, I panicked.  The first time I had to run Meteor I had to invoke <code class="highlighter-rouge">meteor --settings ../config/settings.development.json</code>.  I had a video solution and knew that it should only take a few minutes to invoke.  Mine took over an hour.  Whenever I changed my code, instead of meteor automatically refreshing, it would crash.  The only way for me to get it to work was to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">meteor reset</code>.  However, my biggest frustration with Meteor came when I had a quizzed test with Meteor.  Instead of Meteor taking two minutes to create it's app, it took me nearly ten.  By the time I could finally get to writing code, my computer froze, and I ended up with an incomplete code.  I just could not understand why anyone with a Windows would use Meteor.

## It's a Happy Ending
At first, I assumed all of my problems existed because I was using a Windows laptop.  However, through my friends, I've discovered that Mac users went through similar situations with Meteor freezing their computer and taking forever to run.  Once I realized that it wasn't the type of computer that I owned that caused these problems, I stopped judging Meteor and began to see why Meteor was useful.  With Meteor, people can input their own information on one page and have it saved onto another page.  For example, in my digits code, users could add their information in a form, and when they hit submit, it would show that their information is being stored on another page for others to see.  Meteor also introduces how block users so that only users logged in can view the website.  The point of Meteor is to make a website that acts exactly like a website should.  The easy part about Meteor is that it comes with templates so that it can easily be edited into whatever kind of website a person desires.  Therefore, though I am personally not found of how long it takes to load, for anyone who has a desire to make a website or app and aren't able to make one from scratch, Meteor is a good place to start because it does a good job of making it easy for a beginner.
