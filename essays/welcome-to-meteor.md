# The Meteor Not Found in the Sky

Meteor is known for it's usefulness in creating JavaScript apps.  Especially when paired with Semantic UI, the possibilities of the kinds of websites, apps, and desktops a person can create are endless.  However, it takes a while to reach perfection, and a lot of problems can arise along the way.

## My Relationship with Meteor
From the first day I've been introduced to the Meteor app, the one thing that stuck out to me was that it would not be windows friendly.  As a Windows user, I panicked.  The first time I had to run Meteor I had to invoke <code class="highlighter-rouge">meteor --settings ../config/settings.development.json</code>.  I had a video solution and knew that it should only take a few minutes to invoke.  Mine took over an hour.  Whenever I changed my code, instead of meteor automatically refreshing, it would crash.  The only way for me to get it to work was to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">meteor reset</code>.  Sometimes when I tried to get my app to run, it would run ten minutes to run when it should've only taken two.  At first, I assumed all of my problems existed because I was using a Windows laptop.  However, I discovered that Mac users went through similar situations.  Therefore, I became fustrated with how slow Meteor takes in creating and running my app.

That being said, there is a reason why people use Meteor.  With Meteor, people can input their own information and have it saved into another page.  I can also create the app so that only people logged in can see or do anything with the app.  The point of Meteor is to make a website that acts exactly like a website should.  The easy part about Meteor is that it comes with templates so that it can easily be edited into whatever kind of website a person desires.  Therefore, though I am personally not found of how long it takes to load, for anyone who has a desire to make a website or app and aren't able to make one from scratch, Meteor is a good place to start because it does a good job of making it easy for a beginner.
