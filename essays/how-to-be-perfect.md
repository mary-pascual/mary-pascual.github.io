## Time to Change Things Up!

When computer science/computer engineering students first hear they're going to learn how to create their very own website, their excitement grows.  Creating a website is much different than the programming they have learning in their Introduction to Computer Science classes.  Instead of creating a random program that the student would have never created on their own, the student gets to use their imagination and see how creative they can be.

### Creating a Website: Idealism vs Realism

The beautiful thing about it is that creating a websites (especially when Semantic UI is used) is very straight forward.  With every program a student types and every change a student makes, they can easily see the results of their work, which makes it easier to know what is working and what should be changed.  Also, Semantic ui is very straight forward.  For example, I tried to recreate the [breakout waikiki website](https://www.breakoutwaikiki.com/).
