## Time to Change Things Up!

When computer science/computer engineering students first hear they're going to learn how to create their very own website, their excitement grows.  Creating a website is much different than the programming they have learning in their Introduction to Computer Science classes.  Instead of creating a random program that the student would have never created on their own, the student gets to use their imagination and see how creative they can be.

### Creating a Website: Idealism vs Realism

The beautiful thing about it is that creating a websites (especially when Semantic UI is used) is very straight forward.  With every program a student types and every change a student makes, they can easily see the results of their work, which makes it easier to know what is working and what should be changed.  Also, Semantic ui is very straight forward.  For example, I tried to recreate the [Breakout Waikiki website](https://www.breakoutwaikiki.com/).  Like most websites, this one included a top menu, and because I was creating the website with Semantic UI, I could easily create the top menu with the class "ui menu" and then add another class called "items" under it to list the things I want in that menu.

Well, that sounds pretty straight forward compared to the type of programs done before.  So what could possibly be the downfall?  The downfall is that it's difficult to copy a website exactly as I have learned through the Breakout Waikiki website (and later in the [Murphy's Bar and Grill website](http://murphyshawaii.com/).  For the Breakout Waikiki website, I almost quit trying to recreate the website because I could not match the font style.  No matter how long I search and no matter how many different styles I tried, I could not recreate the font.  If you're like me and need to have everything be exactly alike (especially when it's close to being alike!), then let me give you some personal advice from one type A to another: let it go.

### Is Semantic UI the Only Way?

As I'll probably learn throughout my programming career, there are always more than one way to do things and building websites is included.  Before being introduced to Semantic UI, my Software Engineering class taught a different way to create websites using HTML and CSS.  Though both play a role with Semantic UI, without the Semantic UI, the website looks plain.  It was also very difficult to achieve certain things without Semantic UI.  For example, when you try to replicate a website, more than likely, you will need columns.  With HTML and CSS, my friend and I groaned in fustration when we could not for the life of us figure out why the columns kept looking weird.  We had to put each paragraph in its own column and dictate to the column where it would go (left, center, or right).  However, if one column was not done right, it screwed up all the columns.

On the other hand, Semantic UI has an easy way to include columns.  Simply, insert the class "ui [number of columns desired] column grid container".  Then, you can create a class called "column" and indicate what you want inside each column.  By doing so, less time can be spent on easy tasks that Semantic UI can handle and more time can be spent on other feautures.
