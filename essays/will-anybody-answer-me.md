##Looking Back...

I remember my first lab for my Introduction to Computer Science class.  As expected, the teacher's assistant gave his introductory speech on how he was excited to be teaching this semester and what he expected from us in this class.  He ended his speech by saying that when we want help from him to be specific with our questions.  In other words, I couldn't just ask him "Why won't my code work" (believe me, I tried).  Instead, I had to detect by myself which part of the code was not working, try to figure out by myself why it was not working, and then point it out to the TA to specifically explain my problem.  If I followed those steps, then (and only then) would he help me.

In the beginning, I couldn't make sense about why he would ask us to be as specific with our questions as possible.  In my mind, sometimes a code just doesn't work for a reason we didn't learn yet, and sometimes, we didn't know how to start a code.  What could possibly be wrong with asking questions like, "Can you fix it" or "What are we supposed to be doing"?

##There is No Such Thing as a Bad Question, Right?

Wrong.

It took me up to college to realize how important it is to ask a smart question.  What's a smart question?  A smart question is a question that can not be answered in the textbook the professor has assigned for the class or in the lecture notes that he posted online.  It sounds like a given but experience has told me that it's not as obvious as hoped.  For example, in the same lab, I couldn't figure out why on my sudoku code the numbers would print from 1-10 instead of 0-9.  I desired help from the TA, but unfortunately, someone grabbed the TA's attention first.  It took the whole class for the TA to help the student, and in the end, I wasn't able to get the help I needed before I turned in my assignment.  Later, when I asked the student about her question to the TA, I had to resist letting out a frustrated sigh when it became obvious to me that the solution she seeked was already covered in the textbook.

##Why Smart Questions are Needed

These were just some of my experiences from one semester of Computer Science classes.  In the real world, when people ask questions that can be obviously answered by doing their own research, other people will either look down on the person with the question or ignore the question.  I've seen people that I know even try to make their questions sound more like a smart question by putting themselves down, but it always backfires.

The bottom line is that people who answer other people's questions like to see that the person has tried to work towards the answer.  They don't like to give answers to people who don't even try because they know it takes away from a person's learning expereince.  For example, look at the StackExchange question [here] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41860899/write-a-function-that-takes-2-colors-as-arguments-and-returns-the-average-color).
