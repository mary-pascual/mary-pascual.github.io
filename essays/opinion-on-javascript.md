# On July 2016...
I was introduced to Java.  While programming in Java for both ICS 111 and 211, I thought for a while that learning Java was the worst.  I grew fustrated whenever the right result did not appear in my console or, even worse, when there were null pointers in my eclipse.  I would try to study Java, but for a while, nothing would make sense to me.  Later, I started to get used to the way Java works, but by then, it was too late.  I despised programming.

Reality hit me when I realized that in order to graduate with a Computer Science degree, I would need to take more programming classes.  I was not looking forward to programming in Java again.  However, when the Spring semester began, I was surprised to learn that I would not be programming with Java but with it's distant cousin, Javascript.  While starting to code in Javascript, I waited for the feeling of despair to hit me when I wouldn't be able to understand the programming.

## It Never Came
As soon as I started, I realized that I could understand what I was doing.  It may have helped with the Java background that I previously learned, but I think it had to do more so with the way Javascript works.  In my opinion, Java had a bunch of fancy codes in order to get a simple task done.  Javascript, on the other hand, seemed to go more hand-in-hand with my way of thinking how a code works and should be written.

I have met with people who hate Javascript and people who love Javascript.  I think one of the reasons why Software Engineers should learn Javascript is because maybe they will learn how to program better by learning it a different way.  It's almost like looking at programming with "fresh eyes".  Java and Javascript might be similar, but people still have their preferences, which they won't find unless if they're introduced to different types of programming.  Another reason is because it is pratical.  Not all programming jobs work with Java.  Some work with Javascript.  Others work with Python.  Therefore, it makes sense to be introduced to a variety of different programs in order to be prepared for future jobs.

## A Growth in My Learning
I'm still being introduced to Javascript.  Luckily, my class, ICS 314, has different strategies in order for me to learn the program quickly and efficiently.  One way is by having "Word of the Days" or WOD.  WOD is an activity in which I am given a prompt (usually a math problem) and use Javascript to write out an equation to solve the problem.  It gets difficult at times especially since it's a timed activity, but it definitely is helping me on improving my programming skills.  Another thing we do in class is have homework due frequently.  I think the class does this in order to make sure we really are practicing Javascript every day in order to help us learn while preventing us from cramming.  I won't lie and say that I was thrilled to know that this was the style of the classroom, especially since I am also taking ICS 311: Algorithms, but it does help me in learning.

When I first walked into the classroom, I was worried that this class would not work for me.  There is a lot of work, and especially in college, it gets hard to have good time management.  However, the worry disappeared and excitment has replaced it.  I have accepted that I will have to put in a lot of work in order to get the grade I want in this class.  However, at the moment, I'm enjoying learning how to code with Javascript so in the end, I figure the amount of work I put in will be worth it.
