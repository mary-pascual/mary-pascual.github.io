I am excited to learn a new type of programming and to learn the concepts and the new technologies that come with learning Software Engineering.  As of right now in my second week of class, my biggest interest in Software Engineering is that we use Javascript instead of Java.  So far, Javascript seems to make more sense when I write code.  Javascript also helps me to practice more on my limited knowledge of Java.

Because this is only my third semester doing computer science, I hope that by taking this class that I may improve on my coding skills.  I've always been insecure about coding because I felt as though I could never figure out how to write a code by myself.  Even in my beginning levels of my computer science classes, I also would check with people to see if my code was correct even though the code was simple.  I'm hoping that since software engineering has a lot to do with coding and because this class does WODS frequently that I'll be able to figure out codes on my own and become confident enough to write out my own codes.

My biggest fear is that I will be unprepared for the real work and so I hope to experience real life work from software engineering.  What I mean by that is that typically a class does not exactly show students what they will be expected to do when they get a job.  Because of that, they are unprepared for the professional work forces.  Therefore, I hope by taking this class that I will experience scenarios that will be similar to the scenarios I will face when I get a job.
